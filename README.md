# Player Tracking with YOLOv8 and DeepSORT

This project demonstrates real-time player tracking in a video using the YOLOv8 object detection model combined with the DeepSORT algorithm for Re-Identification (Re-ID). The system first detects players in each frame and then assigns a persistent ID to track them as they move across the scene.

## Features
*   Object Detection Utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv8 model (`best (1).pt`) to detect players, balls, and referees.
*   Player Filtering Isolates 'player' detections to be used specifically for tracking.
*   Real-time Tracking Employs DeepSORT to assign and maintain a unique ID for each player across video frames.
*   Visualization Renders the output video with bounding boxes and unique track IDs overlaid on each player.

## Environment Requirements
*   Python 3.10+
*   Pip (Python package installer)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone or Download the Repository
   First, get the project files onto your local machine.

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended
   It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the environment
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install Dependencies
   Install all the required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python deep-sort-realtime
   ```
   This will install YOLOv8, OpenCV, and the DeepSORT tracker.

4. Place Project Files
   Ensure your project directory is structured as follows:
   ```
   project-folder/
   ├── best (1).pt        # Your trained YOLO model
   ├── track.py           # Your main Python script
   └── your_video.mp4     # The video file you want to process
   ```

 How to Run the Code

1. Configure File Paths
   Open the `track.py` script and modify the following lines to point to your model and video files:

   ```python
   # Line 4: Update with the path to your YOLO model
   model = YOLO("best (1).pt")

   # Line 8: Update with the path to your video file
   cap = cv2.VideoCapture(r"C:\path\to\your\video.mp4")
   ```

2. Execute the Script
   Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python track.py
   ```

3. View the Results
   A window titled "Re-ID Tracking" will open. It will display the video with green bounding boxes around each tracked player, labeled with a unique ID (e.g., "Player 1").

   Press the q key at any time to close the window and stop the script.
